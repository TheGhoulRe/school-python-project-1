# Student Storage App

This is Group 20's first project solution. This solution is an application that stores data of up to 100 students. The data stored includes the following:
* Matric number
* First name
* Last name
* Score (of 100)

For storing the students' data, the application uses CSV. CSV is a data interchange format for storing and exchanging data as text data. The major reason why we are using CSV for this project, is because CSV is easy to work with.

# Getting started

A virtual environment is an independent isolated environment for developing programs safely. Environments are containers for building softwares. The main python environment is the "default" python installation.

Once you've activated the virtual environment, run the command below to start the application:
```bash
$ python3 src/main.py
```
