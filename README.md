# Student Storage App

This is group 20's python project. This project is a Python GUI application created with Tkinter. The major use of this application is to store and analyse student scores.

# Requirements

To run this application successfully, you need to make sure you are running python version 3. To check for your python version, run the following command:
```bash
python --version
```

If you get something like `Python 3.x.x` on as your output, then you are on the right track. If you get something like `Python 2.x.x`, you may need to run the following instead:
```bash
python3 --version
```

After running the command above, if you get `Python 3.x.x`, then there's no worry. It means you need to use `python3` instead of `python` to access python version 3. Example:
```bash
python3 main.py

# instead of 
python main.py
```

If you get an error running `python` or `python3`, or you don't get `Python 3.x.x` from either of them, then you need to install python on your system.

# Getting started

To get this application running the first thing you need to do is install `tkinter` on your system. Tkinter is a libary for building graphical user interfaces in 3. If you don't have it installed in your system, run the following command to install it:
```bash
pip install tk
```

When everything is set up, run the following command to start the application:
```bash
python main.py
```
